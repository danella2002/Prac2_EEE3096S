  * @brief   TASK 6 : NON-BLOCKING EEPROM TRANSACTION STATE MACHINE
  *
  * Restructure the Task 4 transaction so the main loop never stops:
  *
  *   request -> write-enable -> write -> wait for EEPROM
  *           -> read-back -> verify -> result
  *
  * Rules (handout, Task 6):
  *   - No HAL_Delay(), and no software busy-wait for the EEPROM's internal
  *     write cycle. You may use HAL_GetTick() to decide when the next status
  *     check is due.
  *   - Each call does a small amount of work, updates the state, and returns.
  *   - Do not put the whole transaction inside one blocking function called
  *     from the loop.
  *   - While a transaction is in progress the loop must still respond to PA3.
  *
  * Controls: PA0 starts, PA3 aborts. PB0..PB7 show the last byte read, PB11
  * (green) a successful verification, PB10 (red) a failed one.
